    - And all PHP extensions required by [quidphp/base](https://github.com/quidphp/base)

## Dependency
**QuidPHP/Orm** has the following dependencies:
- [quidphp/base](https://github.com/quidphp/base) -Â Quid\Base - PHP library that provides a set of low-level static methods
- [quidphp/main](https://github.com/quidphp/main) - Quid\Main - PHP library that provides a set of base objects and collections 

All dependencies will be resolved by using the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installation process.

## Comment

## Convention
**QuidPHP/Orm** is built on the following conventions:
- *Traits*: Traits filenames start with an underscore (_).
- *Coding*: No curly braces are used in a IF statement if the condition can be resolved in only one statement.
- *Type*: Files, function arguments and return types are strict typed.
- *Config*: A special $config static property exists in all classes. This property gets recursively merged with the parents' property on initialization.
- *Dynamic singleton*: Table, Col, Row and Cell objects can only exist once for a same source.
